    <h2>Rice</h2>
    <p>Come enjoy a Classic dish </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 1/3 cup oil (vegetable/canola/coconut, not olive oil)

            6 fresh, red poblano peppers (or 4 large red bell peppers), seeds discarded
            3 medium-sized red onions (1 sliced thinly, 2 roughly chopped), divided
            3 tablespoons tomato paste
        </li>
        <li>6 medium-sized fresh plum/Roma tomatoes, chopped, OR a 400-gram tin of tomatoes</li>
        1/2 to 1 hot pepper, or to taste (yellow Scotch bonnets are my favourite)
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a blender, combine tomatoes, red poblano (or bell) peppers, chopped onions, and Scotch bonnets with 2 cups of stock, blend till smooth, about a minute or two. You should have roughly 6 cups of blended mix. Pour into a large pot/ pan and bring to the boil then turn down and let simmer, partly covered for 10 - 12 minutes</li>
        <li>In a large pan, heat oil and add the sliced onions. Season with a pinch of salt, stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes, then add the bay leaves, curry powder and dried thyme and a pinch of black pepper for 3 - 4 minutes on medium heat. Then add the tomato paste - stir for another 2 minutes. Add the reduced tomato-pepper-Scotch bonnet mixture, stir, and set on medium heat for 10 to 12 minutes till reduced by half, with the lid partly on. This is the stew that will define the pot.</li>
        <li>Add 4 cups of the stock to the cooked tomato sauce and bring it to boil for 1 - 2 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
