    <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
    <h3>Pastry</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put all Pastry ingredients (except the water) in a food processor and tap the pulse button to slowly
            incorporate the butter into the flour.
            If doing by hand rub butter into flour until it represents fine breadcrumbs, try to work as quick as
            possible to avoid butter melting
            250 grams (2 cups) Plain Flour (All Purpose),115 grams (½ cup) Unsalted Butter,1 teaspoon Turmeric,1
            teaspoon Salt,1 teaspoon Garam Masala</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add ice-cold water bit by bit and knead with hands into the dough until it forms a playdoh like texture.
            (you may need a little less/more water than stated above)
            Try not to handle to much.
            120 ml (½ cup) Ice Cold Water</li>
        <br>
        <li>Place pastry covered in the fridge whilst you create the beef filling.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
        <h3><em>Beef mince patty filling</em></h3>
        <li>Heat oil in pan and add onions and red peppers sautee for 5 minutes until soft, add spring onions.</li>
        <li>Add mince, garlic, chilli, paprika, garam masala, turmeric and salt. Stir through until mince has browned
        </li>
        <li>Finally add dried/fresh thyme and stock.
            Place lid on and leave to simmer for 15 minutes whilst you cut out pastry.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
        <h3>Create Patties</h3>
        <li>Preheat oven to 180°C fan/ 200°C/ 400°F / Gas Mark 6.
            Remove pastry from fridge, flour surface and roll out very thin.</li>
        <li>Use a saucer/small plate (about 17cm diameter) to cut around the pastry.
            Re-roll remaining pastry until all used up, you should have 5-6 circles.
            Or you could use smaller plates and create smaller patties?!</li>
        <li>Now put rolled out circles on to there own bit of parchment paper and add 2-3 tablespoon of beef mixture in
            the middle</li>
        <li>Use finger to dap the outer circle with water</li>
        <li>Fold pastry over the mince and use a fork to crimp the edges together</li>
        <li>Whisk egg with water and brush on pastry to glaze.
            For a flat pastry fork a hole in the top.
            For a puffed-up pastry (as I like them) leave out the hole!</li>
        <li>Place all completed patties on to a tray (or two) and cook in the 180°C fan/ 200°C/ 400°F / Gas Mark 6 oven
            for 20-25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
