    <h2>Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon cooking oil</li>
        <li>1/2 pound(225 grams) skirt steak, trimmed</li>
        <li>1/2 medium(55 grams) yellow onion, sliced</li>
        <li>4 slices(30 grams each) Italian bread</li>
        <li>4 slices(30 grams each) sharp cheddar</li>
        <li>1 medium (120 grams) bell pepper, sliced</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Directions</h2>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 425°F, and spray a baking sheet with cooking oil. Season the steak with salt and pepper.</p>
    <p>Preheat a small nonstick skillet over medium heat with cooking oil. When pan is hot enough for oil to slide
        around easily, add the steak. Cook for 3-4 minutes on each side or until steak reaches desired doneness. Set
        aside until cool enough to handle; slice thinly.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, sauté onions in the same pan, on medium-high heat, until golden brown. Set aside.</p>
    <p>Add the bread slices to the baking sheet. Top each bread slice with one slice of cheddar cheese. Bake for about 5
        minutes until cheese is melted. </p>
    <p>Layer the steak, onions, and bell peppers onto each bread slice, and serve.</p>
